# Multi-User Shared Installation Example
#
# Use case: Shared server where multiple users access Searchat
# Each user has their own Claude conversations but shares the search instance
#
# Setup:
# 1. Place this file at: /etc/searchat/settings.toml
# 2. Set SEARCHAT_DATA_DIR to shared location
# 3. Users override with personal paths via environment variables

[paths]
# Shared data directory (ensure proper permissions)
search_directory = "/var/lib/searchat"

# Template paths - users override with environment variables
claude_directory_windows = "C:/Users/{username}/.claude"
claude_directory_wsl = "\\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu\\home\\{username}\\.claude"

# Auto-detect each user's environment
auto_detect_environment = true

[indexing]
# Larger batch size for server deployment
batch_size = 2000

# Auto-index enabled
auto_index = true

# More frequent updates in shared environment
index_interval_minutes = 30

# More workers for better performance
max_workers = 8

[search]
default_mode = "hybrid"
max_results = 100
snippet_length = 200

[embedding]
model = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
batch_size = 64  # Larger batch for better throughput
cache_embeddings = true

[ui]
theme = "auto"
font_family = "Segoe UI"
font_size = 11
highlight_color = "#FFEB3B"

[performance]
# Higher limits for shared server
memory_limit_mb = 8000
query_cache_size = 500
enable_profiling = false

# User-specific overrides via environment:
#
# export SEARCHAT_WINDOWS_PROJECTS_DIR=/home/alice/.claude
# export SEARCHAT_PORT=8001  # Different port per user
