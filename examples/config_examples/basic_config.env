# Basic Configuration Example
# Minimal setup for getting started with Searchat

# Data directory (where indexes and logs are stored)
SEARCHAT_DATA_DIR=C:/Users/YourUsername/.searchat

# Server port (default: 8000, auto-scans 8000-8010 if not set)
# SEARCHAT_PORT=8000

# That's it! Most users only need to set the data directory.
# All other settings will use sensible defaults.
