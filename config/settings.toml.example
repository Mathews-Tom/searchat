# WSL native .claude directory (lives at /home/syd/.claude inside WSL, accessed from Windows via network path)
# NOTE: This is NOT /mnt/c/Users/Syd/.claude (which would be the Windows .claude accessed FROM WSL)

# ISOLATION: Using separate search directory to prevent conflicts when running multiple
# application variations (cs, cs1, cs2) concurrently. Shared directories would cause
# FAISS index corruption and parquet file contention during simultaneous writes.
